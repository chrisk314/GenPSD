by parameters supplied by the user in a plain text file.

Input parameters:

a, b         - Specify the analytical form of the PSD as given by the beta 
               distribution [VOI07]. Eqn. 5.15 p.139 [RAD11].
d_max, d_min - Maximum and minimum particle diameters in distribution.
N_p_min      - Minimum required number of particles in distribution.
N_pc_min     - Minimum required number of particles in each size class.
N_c          - Required number of size classes.
C_r          - Representativity criterion; degree of statistical error as
               given by eqn. 5.24 p.143 [RAD11]
